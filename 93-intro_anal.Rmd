# R Analysis using R Markdown {#rmdanal}

In this chapter, you'll see many of the ways that R stores objects and more details on how you can use functions to solve problems in R.  You'll be working with a common dataset derived from something that you likely have encounted before:  the periodic table from chemistry.

## A beginning workflow

- "File organization and naming are powerful weapons against chaos." - Jenny Bryan

## Using R with periodic table dataset

- The `library` function

## Mean, median, standard deviation, five-number summary, distribution

## Additional content to cover

+ data structures (vectors, lists, data frames, matrices)
+ Vectorized operations
+ indexing/subsetting
+ functions (default arguments)
+ Case matters in R!
+ Why do some arguments require quotations and others don't?

## R Markdown templates
