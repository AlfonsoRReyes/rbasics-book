A review of many of the common R errors encountered (and what they mean in laymen's terms) will also provided be provided. (These will be updated over the next academic year.)  Many screenshots and GIFs will be included, but if further clarification is needed on these or any other aspect of the book, please create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/ismayc/rbasics/issues) or email [me](mailto:chester.ismay@gmail.com) with a reference to the error/area where more guidance is necessary.

It is recommended that you have R version 3.3.0 or later, RStudio Desktop version 0.99 or higher, and `rmarkdown` R package version 1.0 or higher.  This is to make sure that the screenshots and GIF recordings match up with the behavior on your machine/set-up.
