# Introduction {#intro}

This book was written using the **bookdown** R package from Yihui Xie.  You can find different formats for the book by clicking on the save icon `r knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/save_icon.png")` in the top pane of this book website.  HTML is the preferred format but PDF and ePub formats are also available.

This resource is designed to provide new users to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown with the introductory steps needed to begin their own reproducible research.
