<div id="what-is-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> What is R?</h2>
<p>In Chapter <a href="whyR.html#whyR">2</a>, I discussed many of the reasons why you should be doing your analyses (especially those of the data type) using R. If you skipped over that chapter in the hopes of just hopping into learning about R, I request that you to go back to it and carefully read it over. As you begin working with R, it is especially important to review that introductory chapter from time to time.</p>
<div id="r-beginnings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> R beginnings</h3>
<p>R was created by a group of statisticians who wanted an open-source alternative to the costly proprietary options. Being created by statisticians (instead of computer scientists) means that R has some quirky aspects to it that take a little bit of time to get used to. We’ll see that many packages have been developed to help with this and that you don’t need to have advanced degrees in Statistics to be able to work with R now.</p>
<p>Getting back to the development of R… R was created by <strong>R</strong>oss Ihaka and <strong>R</strong>obert Gentleman in New Zealand at the University of Auckland. It is a spin-off of the S programming language and is named partly after the first names of its developers (as you can see in the emphasis above). The beginning ideas for creating R came in 1992 and the first version of R was released in 1994. You can find much more about the background of R and its features as well as its connections to the S language on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> R packages</h3>
<p>I first learned to use R while a graduate student at Northern Arizona University from <a href="http://www.stat.colostate.edu/~pturk/">Dr. Philip Turk</a> in 2007. At the time, I never thought that R could have exploded in users as we have seen since 2011. I never would have thought that students taking an introductory statistics course would be encouraged to learn to use R.</p>
<p>In 2007, it was still largely esoteric and tricky language used by statisticians to do analyses. Getting used to the syntax for producing plots and working with data was especially tricky for those with little to no programming experience. So what has changed since 2007 about learning R?</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest developments has been the creation of packages to make R easier to work with for newbies. Packages are created by users of R to increase the functionality of the base R installation. Packages created by Hadley Wickham and others recently have greatly expanded the capabilities of R, while also working to make beginning with R simpler. From the Wikipedia page referenced earlier, as of January 2016, there were around 7800 additional R packages available on common R repositories.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Another great development is the graphical user interface called RStudio and the package developed by the those that work for RStudio, Inc. called <code>rmarkdown</code>. We will discuss <code>rmarkdown</code> (also referred to as RMarkdown) in a Chapter <a href="rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">4</a>, and will now focus on discussing RStudio.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="what-is-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> What is RStudio?</h2>
<p>RStudio is a powerful, free, open-source integrated development environment for R. It began development in 2010 and its first beta release came in February 2011. It is available in two editions: RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server. This book will focus mostly on using the RStudio Server, but both versions are nearly identical to work with.</p>
<p>You can find instructions linked below for downloading R and RStudio on Windows and Mac machines. If you are using RStudio Server, your professor and members of your organization’s IT department have done these steps for you. On the RStudio Server you log on using a web browser to an account sitting on the cloud. There are many advantages to using the RStudio Server for the beginning user including sharing of R projects to help with feedback and error resolution. Installation of software can also cause its own headaches and this is eliminated by using the RStudio Server.</p>
<p><strong>Note for advanced users</strong>: You can also install your very own RStudio Server for around $5 per month on Digital Ocean. Instructions to do so can be found from Dean Attali <a href="http://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/">here</a> and on the Digital Ocean site <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-rstudio-on-an-ubuntu-cloud-server">here</a>.</p>
<p>After you complete a few months of work with the RStudio Server, it is recommended that you download RStudio Desktop to your computer. The instructions to do so are below.</p>
<div id="installing-r-and-rstudio-desktop" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Installing R and RStudio Desktop</h3>
<p>A step-by-step guide to installing R and RStudio Desktop with screenshots can be found</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/software/R/r_studio.html">here</a> for the Mac and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/software/R/r_studio_pc.html">here</a> for a PC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you plan to create PDF documents (which requires a multiple gigabyte download of LaTeX) you can skip some of the later steps of the installation. It is recommended that you select <strong>HTML</strong> as the Default Output Format for RMarkdown. You’ll see more about this in Chapter <a href="rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">4</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="working-in-rstudio-server" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Working in RStudio Server</h2>
<div id="logging-in-and-initial-screen" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Logging in and initial screen</h3>
<p>The RStudio Server provides a web-based way to run analyses in R. This means that you will only need an internet connection and a web browser to run your analyses. Your professor or administrator will provide you with a link to the web location of your RStudio Server. After entering the link, you’ll see a page that looks something like:</p>
<p><img src="screenshots/server_login.png" width="533" /></p>
<p>After logging in with your username and password, you should see a layout similar to what follows.</p>
<p><img src="screenshots/initial_rstudio.png" width="831" /></p>
<p>For your own reference, a screenshot of RStudio Desktop looks like:</p>
<p><img src="screenshots/desktop_initial.png" width="1153" /></p>
<p>As you can see they are almost identical. This makes working between the two different RStudio set-ups painless. A discussion of what each of the three different RStudio panes (will soon be four panes) and their corresponding tabs will occur in Chapter <a href="rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">4</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-workflow" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Basic workflow</h3>
<p>A good habit to get into whenever you start a new project with R code is to create a new RStudio project to go along with it. RStudio project files have the extension <code>.Rproj</code> and store metadata that goes along with the documents you’ve saved and information about the R environment you are working in. More information about RStudio projects is available from RStudio, Inc. <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are sharing homework or lab assignments with your instructor, for example, it might make sense to create an RStudio project, share it with your instructor, and then create new folders for each lab. We will follow this example below.</p>
<p>The GIF below shows you how to create a new RStudio project called <code>initial</code> and also your first RMarkdown file. Note that you also may see a description about what version of R is running on your initial login like shown in the GIF below in the Console pane.</p>
<p><img src="gifs/proj_rmd.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Now that we have our <strong>first_rmarkdown.Rmd</strong> file set up. You will an example of how to share this project with another user. This will enable you and collaborators (other students, your instructor, etc.) to work on the <strong>Rmd</strong> file at the same time. This is similar to working on a Google Doc at the same time as someone else.</p>
</div>
<div id="sharing-rstudio-projects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Sharing RStudio Projects</h3>
<p>RStudio Server comes in a couple different formats and you’ll need to make sure you (or your IT administrator) have installed RStudio Server Pro to use the Shared Projects feature. You can find more information from RStudio, Inc. on this <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/211659737-Sharing-Projects-in-RStudio-Server-Pro">here</a>. Below is an example GIF of sharing this <code>initial</code> project with another user of the RStudio Server.</p>
<p><img src="gifs/share_proj.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">4</a>, you’ll see why it is recommended you work in RMarkdown files and you’ll also begin to see some examples of how R works with RMarkdown.</p>
