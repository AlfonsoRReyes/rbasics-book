<div id="what-is-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> What is R?</h2>
<p>In Chapter <a href="whyR.html#whyR">2</a>, I discussed many of the reasons why you should be doing your analyses (especially those of the data type) using R. If you skipped over that chapter in the hopes of just hopping into learning about R, I request that you to go back to it and carefully read it over. As you begin working with R, it is especially important to review that introductory chapter from time to time.</p>
<div id="r-beginnings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> R beginnings</h3>
<p>R was created by a group of statisticians who wanted an open-source alternative to the costly proprietary options. Being created by statisticians (instead of computer scientists) means that R has some quirky aspects to it that take a little bit of time to get used to. We’ll see that many packages have been developed to help with this and that you don’t need to have advanced degrees in Statistics to be able to work with R now.</p>
<p>Getting back to the development of R… R was created by <strong>R</strong>oss Ihaka and <strong>R</strong>obert Gentleman in New Zealand at the University of Auckland. It is a spin-off of the S programming language and is named partly after the first names of its developers (as you can see in the emphasis above). The beginning ideas for creating R came in 1992 and the first version of R was released in 1994. You can find much more about the background of R and its features as well as its connections to the S language on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> R packages</h3>
<p>I first learned to use R while a graduate student at Northern Arizona University from <a href="http://www.stat.colostate.edu/~pturk/">Dr. Philip Turk</a> in 2007. At the time, I never thought that R could have exploded in users as we have seen since 2011. I never would have thought that students taking an introductory statistics course would be encouraged to learn to use R.</p>
<p>In 2007, it was still largely esoteric and tricky language used by statisticians to do analyses. Getting used to the syntax for producing plots and working with data was especially tricky for those with little to no programming experience. So what has changed since 2007 about learning R?</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest developments has been the creation of packages to make R easier to work with for newbies. Packages are created by users of R to increase the functionality of the base R installation. Packages created by Hadley Wickham and others recently have greatly expanded the capabilities of R, while also working to make beginning with R simpler. From the Wikipedia page referenced earlier, as of January 2016, there were around 7800 additional R packages available on common R repositories.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Another great development is the graphical user interface called RStudio and the package developed by the those that work for RStudio, Inc. called <code>rmarkdown</code>. We will discuss <code>rmarkdown</code> (also referred to as RMarkdown) in a Chapter <a href="rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">4</a>, and will now focus on discussing RStudio.</p>

</div>
<div id="what-is-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> What is RStudio?</h2>
<p>RStudio is a powerful, free, open-source integrated development environment for R. It began development in 2010 and its first beta release came in February 2011. It is available in two editions: RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server. This book will focus mostly on using the RStudio Server, but both versions are nearly identical to work with.</p>
<p>You can find instructions linked below for downloading R and RStudio on Windows and Mac machines. If you are using RStudio Server, your professor and members of your organization’s IT department have done these steps for you. On the RStudio Server you log on using a web browser to an account sitting on the cloud. There are many advantages to using the RStudio Server for the beginning user including sharing of R projects to help with feedback and error resolution. Installation of software can also cause its own headaches and this is eliminated by using the RStudio Server.</p>
<p>After you complete a few months of work with the RStudio Server, it is recommended that you download RStudio Desktop to your computer. The instructions to do so are below.</p>
<div id="installing-r-and-rstudio-desktop" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Installing R and RStudio Desktop</h3>
<p>A step-by-step guide to installing R and RStudio Desktop with screenshots can be found</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/software/R/r_studio.html">here</a> for the Mac and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/software/R/r_studio_pc.html">here</a> for a PC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you plan to create PDF documents (which requires a multiple gigabyte download of LaTeX) you can skip some of the later steps of the installation. It is recommended that you select <strong>HTML</strong> as the Default Output Format for RMarkdown. You’ll see more about this in Chapter <a href="rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">4</a>.</p>
